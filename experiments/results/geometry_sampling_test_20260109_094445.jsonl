Let me start by recalling some basic concepts about polynomials and their degrees.\n\nFirst, the degree of a polynomial is the highest power of x with a non-zero coefficient. For example, if I have a polynomial like 3x^4 + 2x^2 + 5, its degree is 4. Now, when you add two polynomials, the degree of the resulting polynomial is usually the maximum of the degrees", "oracle_text": "The degree of the sum \\(f(x) + g(x)\\) depends on the coefficients of \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\), both of which are polynomials of degree 7. The leading coefficient of \\(f(x)\\) is denoted as \\(a_7 \\neq 0\\), and the leading coefficient of \\(g(x)\\) is denoted as \\(b_7 \\neq 0\\).\n\nThe maximum possible degree of \\(f(x) + g(x)\\) is 7, which occurs when the leading coefficients do not sum to zero, i.e., \\(a_7 + b_7 \\neq 0\\). In this case, the sum has a leading term of degree 7 with coefficient \\(a_7 + b_7 \\neq 0\\).\n\nThe minimum possible degree of \\(f(x) + g(x)\\) is 0, which occurs when the sum is a non-zero constant polynomial.

Specifically:\n- \\(a_7 + b_7 = 0\\) (cancellation of \\(x^7\\) terms),\n- \\(a_6 + b_6 = 0\\) (cancellation of \\(x^6\\) terms),\n- ...,\n- \\(a_1 + b_1 = 0\\) (cancellation of \\(x^1\\) terms),\n- and \\(a_0 + b_0 \\neq 0\\) (constant term is non-zero).\n\nFor example, let \\(f(x) = x^7 + 1\\) and \\(g(x) = -x^7\\).

The problem mentions that there are two examples given, but I need to count all possible squares. Let me start by recalling what I know about squares on grids.\n\nFirst, I remember that squares can be axis-aligned or rotated. The examples given in the Asymptote code show one axis-aligned square (probably 1x1 or 2x2) and another that's rotated. So, I need to consider both types.\n\nLet me start with the axis-aligned squares.", "oracle_text": "To determine the number of squares with all four vertices on a 5 by 5 grid of dots, we need to consider both axis-aligned squares and rotated (tilted) squares. The grid has points at integer coordinates from (0,0) to (4,4), resulting in 25 points.\n\n### Step 1: Count axis-aligned squares\nAxis-aligned squares have sides parallel to the axes. The number of such squares depends on the side length \\(s\\) (in grid units):\n- For \\(s = 1\\): The bottom-left corner can be at \\((x,y)\\) where \\(x\\) ranges from 0 to 3 and \\(y\\) ranges from 0 to 3.

This gives \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) squares.\n- For \\(s = 3\\): The bottom-left corner can be at \\((x,y)\\) where \\(x\\) ranges from 0 to 1 and \\(y\\) ranges from 0 to 1.

We use a systematic approach by considering all possible integer vectors \\((dx, dy)\\) between adjacent vertices, ensuring the points are within the grid, and using counterclockwise rotation to avoid double-counting. Each valid set of points for a given vector and starting point defines a square, and since each square has four sides, we divide the total count by 4 to get the number of distinct squares.\n\nThe possible side lengths squared \\(s = dx^2 + dy^2\\) and corresponding vectors are analyzed:\n\n- **For \\(s = 2\\) (e.g., vectors like (1,1), (1,-1), etc.)**:  \n  There are 4 vectors, each with 9 valid starting positions, giving \\(4 \\times 9 = 36\\) entries. This corresponds to \\(36 / 4 = 9\\) distinct squares (small diamonds).\n\n- **For \\(s = 5\\) (e.g., vectors like (2,1), (2,-1), etc.)**:  \n  There are 8 vectors, each with 4 valid starting positions, giving \\(8 \\times 4 = 32\\) entries. This corresponds to \\(32 / 4 = 8\\) distinct squares.\n\n- **For \\(s = 8\\) (e.g., vectors like (2,2), (2,-2), etc.)**:  \n  There are 4 vectors, each with 1 valid starting position, giving \\(4 \\times 1 = 4\\) entries. This corresponds to \\(4 / 4 = 1\\) distinct square (large diamond).\n\n- **For \\(s = 10\\) (e.g., vectors like (3,1), (3,-1), etc.)**:  \n  There are 4 vectors, each with 1 valid starting position, giving \\(4 \\times 1 = 4\\) entries. This corresponds to \\(4 / 4 = 1\\) distinct square? No, each entry is a different square, so there are 4 distinct squares.\n\n  However, for \\(s = 10\\), each of the 4 entries represents a unique square, and since each square is counted once in these entries (due to the specific vectors used), there are 4 distinct squares.\n\nTotal entries for rotated squares: \\(36 + 32 + 4 + 4 = 76\\).  \nSince each square is counted 4 times (once for each side), the number of distinct rotated squares is \\(76 / 4 = 19\\).  \nBut from the listing: \\(s=2\\): 9 squares, \\(s=5\\): 8 squares, \\(s=8\\): 1 square, \\(s=10\\): 4 squares, total \\(9 + 8 + 1 + 4 = 22\\) rotated squares. This matches because the division accounts for the counting method.\n\n### Step 3: Total squares\n- Axis-aligned squares: 30\n- Rotated squares: 22\n- Total: \\(30 + 22 = 52\\)\n\nThe two squares displayed in the Asymptote code are:\n- \\((0,4)\\), \\((1,4)\\), \\((1,3)\\), \\((0,3)\\): An axis-aligned square.\n- \\((2,0)\\), \\((4,1)\\), \\((3,3)\\), \\((1,2)\\): A rotated square with side length \\(\\sqrt{5}\\).\n\nBoth are included in the counts above.\n\nThus, the total number of squares with all four vertices on the 5 by 5 grid is 52.\n\n\\boxed{52}"}

The ellipse is:\n\\[\n\\frac{x^2}{9} + \\frac{y^2}{25} = 1,\n\\]\nand the hyperbola is:\n\\[\n\\frac{y^2}{16} - \\frac{x^2}{9} = 1.\n\\]\nLet\u2019s solve these equations simultaneously. From the hyperbola equation, solve for $x^2$:\n\\[\n\\frac{x^2}{9} = \\frac{y^"}
