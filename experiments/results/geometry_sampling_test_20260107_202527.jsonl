Let me first write down the equations again to make sure I have them right:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{x^2}{2^2 - 1} + \\frac{y^2}{2^2 - 3^2} + \\frac{z^2}{2^2 - 5^2} + \\frac{w^2}{2^2 - 7^2} &= 1 \\\\\n\\frac{x^2}{4", " Okay, so I need to find the value of $ w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 $ given these four equations.

I need to find the complex number w, which is the result of rotating z around c by \u03c0/4 counter-clockwise. Hmm, rotations in complex numbers... I remember that rotating a complex number around another point involves some steps. Let me recall.\n\nFirst, I think the general formula for rotating a point around another point is something like translating the point so that the center of rotation becomes the origin, applying the rotation, and then translating back. So if I want to rotate z around c by \u03b8 radians, the formula would be something like:\n\nw = (z - c) * e^(i", " Alright, so I need to find the complex number $ w $ which is the result of rotating $ z $ around $ c $ by $ \\frac{\\pi}{4} $ counter-clockwise. Let me recall how complex numbers work with rotations. \n\nFirst, I remember that rotating a complex number around another point involves translating the coordinate system so that the center of rotation becomes the origin, performing the rotation, and then translating back. So the general formula for rotating a point $ z $ around a point $ c $ by an angle $ \\theta $ is:\n\n$$\nw = (z - c) \\cdot e^{i\\", " Okay, so I need to find the complex number w, which is the result of rotating z around c by \u03c0/4 counter-clockwise. Let me recall how to perform rotations in the complex plane. \n\nFirst, I remember that rotating a complex number around another point involves translating the system so that the center of rotation becomes the origin, performing the rotation, and then translating back. \n\nSo, let me write down the given complex numbers. The complex number z is 2 + \u221a2 - (3 + 3\u221a2)i. Let me parse that: the real part is 2 + \u221a2, and the", " Okay, so I need to find the complex number w, which is the result of rotating z around c by \u03c0/4 radians counter-clockwise.
