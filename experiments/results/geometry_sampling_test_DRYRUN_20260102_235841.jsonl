For example, if you have 1 apple and you get 1 more apple, you end up with the total number of apples.\n\n**Step 3: Perform the addition**  \nStart with the first number (1). Adding the second number (1) means moving one step up on the number line:  \n- Begin at 1.  \n- Add 1, which takes you to the next whole number.  \nSo, \\(1 + 1 = 2\\).\n\n**Step 4: Verify the result**  \nYou can double-check using basic arithmetic:  \n- In decimal form, 1 and 1 add up to 2.  \n- This is consistent across all representations (e.g., using objects: one item plus one item makes two items).\n\n**Conclusion**  \nThe sum of 1 and 1 is 2.\n\n\\boxed{2}"}
