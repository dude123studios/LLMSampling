Addition is one of the basic arithmetic operations, and it involves combining two or more numbers to find their total sum.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers to add**:  \n   We have two numbers: the first number is 1, and the second number is 1.\n\n2. **Understand addition**:  \n   Addition means combining quantities. For example, if you have 1 apple and you get 1 more apple, you now have 2 apples. Similarly, starting from 1 and adding 1 more unit gives a total of 2 units.\n\n3. **Perform the addition**:  \n   - Start with the first number: 1.  \n   - Add the second number: 1.  \n   - Combine them: 1 + 1 = 2.  \n\n4. **Verify the result**:  \n   This is a fundamental math fact. You can think of it on a number line:  \n   - Begin at 1 on the number line.  \n   - Move 1 unit to the right (since we're adding).  \n   - You land on 2.  \n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"}
