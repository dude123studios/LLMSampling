The problem is: **What is 1 + 1?**\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understand the operation**: The \"+\" symbol means addition. Addition is the process of combining two or more numbers to find their total or sum.\n\n2. **Identify the numbers**: Here, we have two numbers: the first number is 1, and the second number is also 1.\n\n3. **Start with the first number**: Begin at the number 1. You can think of this as having one object, like one apple.\n\n4. **Add the second number**: Since we're adding 1, we add one more object to the first one. For example, if you have one apple and you get another apple, you now have:\n   - First apple + Second apple = Two apples.\n\n5. **Count the total**: After adding, we count the combined amount. Starting from 1 and adding 1 means we move one step forward on the number line:\n   - From 1, the next number is 2.\n   - So, 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n6. **Verify with basic addition facts**: In basic arithmetic, adding 1 to any number gives the next highest number. Since the number after 1 is 2, this confirms that 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**1 + 1 = 2**\n\nThis is a fundamental math fact, and it's great that you're practicing step-by-step thinking! If you have any more questions or need help with another problem, just let me know. \ud83d\ude0a"}
